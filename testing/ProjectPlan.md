## 1 Introduction

[![UIMockups.pdf](UIMockups.pdf)](UIMockups.pdf) (v2.0)
*"GroceryListManagers" is a simple and intuitive application that supports multiple lists at a time for the user to add, delete, change the quantity of items. The user can check off the item in the list or eliminate the mark with a single tap, which allows each list to be reused.*

## 2 Process Description

### Inception Phase
*The goal at this phase is to establish an initial use-case model to demonstrate feasibility through the gathered requirements. And initializes the overall structure of the application, including major features and constraints.*
- Entrance criteria: A comprehensive list of features Brad and Janet envisioned.
- Exit criteria: Feasible requirements that prove through use cases. 

### Eloboration Phase
*The goal is to visualize the requirements, analyze the requirements from the inception phase, and establish the architectural foundation.*
- Entrance criteria: Requirements that agree on scope definitions and are validated by major use cases.
- Exit criteria: Complete project plans and supplementary non-functional requirements that not fit use cases. The executable architecture includes all models and documentation. The criteria for passing this phase are whether the planning is meticulous and whether the unsafe elements in the use case tests are eliminated.

### Construction Phase
*Continue to evolve the requirements and architecture through code implementation to analyze, design, develop and test the application for all required functionality.*
- Entrance criteria: Executable architecture and production models.
- Exit criteria: Documentation descriptions and user manuals of applicable applications. The criteria for passing this phase are whether the application is stable and whether the result of the test case meets all requirements.

### Transition Phase
*Publish the application, submit it to end-users, and make final updates and performance optimizations based on user feedback.*
- Entrance criteria: Runnable applications.
- Exit criteria: The user satisfied with the application.
