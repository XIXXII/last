How to use the TipCalculator App

• After opening the app, the user will see the section that can be entered, "Check amount" and "Party size"

• Please directly enter the amount and number of people and click on button "COMPUT TIP". [Note: the "Check amount" and "Party size" should not be empty. If you miss any of the parts, you will get an error alert.]

• If you put in any information that is valid then the calculator will equally distribute the check amout to each person, and you're going to get tip value, which is 15%, 20%, 25%. Also you're going to get total amount that each person need to pay according to 15%, 20%, 25%

• If you want to calculate another check at the same time, just click on button "CLEAR". All the input and calculation result will be deleted, so you can type in new value.
